I'm colour blind (colourblind, color blind, colorblind; you do you). Green (deuteranopia) colour blind to be specific.
- deuteranopia: unable to perceive `green` light (common)
- protanopia: unable to perceive any `red` light (common)
- tritanopia: are unable to perceive `blue` light (rare)

I've spent years looking for a theme with colours that convey to _me_ the same amount of information as they do to non-colour blind people.

Shout out to [tol theme](https://github.com/dustypomerleau/tol) for giving me the best theme for the last few years, and the breadcrumb to find [Paul Tol's notes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/). This document has been a godsend for shinking my solution space when it comes to finding colours that I can actually comfortably look at next to each other. Then I found the [IBM's Carbon palette](https://www.ibm.com/design/language/color/) which had the missing ingredient: the greyscales. 



Mashup of Paul Tol and IBM Carbon colour palettes that is green colour blind friendly.
